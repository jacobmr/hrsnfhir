## Executive Summary

The New York State Health-Related Social Needs (HRSN) FHIR Data Processing System is a critical infrastructure component supporting the NYS Health Equity Reform (NYHER) 1115 Waiver Amendment. This system will standardize the collection, processing, and analysis of health-related social needs data across New York State's Social Care Networks (SCNs), enabling effective tracking of Enhanced HRSN Services and supporting data-driven decision making for vulnerable Medicaid populations.

The system processes FHIR-compliant data bundles containing screening responses, eligibility assessments, and service referrals, transforming them into actionable insights for program administration, quality improvement, and regulatory reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

**Key Business Value:**
- Standardized HRSN data collection across 62 counties in New York State
- Real-time monitoring of Enhanced HRSN Services delivery
- Compliance with federal FHIR interoperability requirements
- Data-driven insights for addressing health disparities
- Streamlined reporting to CMS for waiver compliance

## Conclusion

The HRSN FHIR Data Processing System represents a critical investment in New York State's health equity initiative, enabling standardized data collection and analysis across the Social Care Network ecosystem. By implementing this system, NYS will achieve federal compliance requirements while building the data infrastructure necessary for evidence-based program improvements and sustainable health equity outcomes.

The system's modular design and adherence to industry standards ensures scalability and adaptability to evolving program needs, while its comprehensive analytics capabilities will provide unprecedented visibility into HRSN service delivery and member outcomes across the state.

Success of this initiative requires coordinated effort across multiple stakeholder groups, sustained executive commitment, and adequate resource allocation. With proper implementation and ongoing support, this system will serve as a model for other states implementing similar health equity initiatives and contribute to the national advancement of social determinants of health data infrastructure.
